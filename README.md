# **Weather Forecast Application \- Project Documentation**

---

## **1Ô∏è. Objective**

The **Weather Forecast Application** is a web-based project that allows users to check real-time weather conditions for any location. The application utilizes the **OpenWeatherMap API** to retrieve weather data and dynamically displays information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The system also provides an extended 5-day weather forecast and supports geolocation for fetching weather data of the user's current location.

## **2Ô∏è. Functionalities Implemented**

*  **Search by City Name:**  
   Users can search for weather conditions by entering a city name in the search bar.  
* **Current Location Weather Data:**  
   The application uses the Geolocation API to retrieve the user's current latitude and longitude and fetch weather data accordingly.  
*  **Recent Search Dropdown:**  
   The system maintains a list of recently searched cities in a dropdown menu using **local storage**, allowing users to quickly revisit previous locations.  
*  **5-Day Weather Forecast:**  
   Displays an extended forecast with details such as temperature, weather icons, wind speed, and humidity.  
*  **UI for Multiple Devices:**  
   Responsive design to ensure compatibility with desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.  
*  **Error Handling and Input Validation:**  
   Validates search queries and handles API errors gracefully, displaying appropriate error messages when required.  
*  **Interactive User Interface:**  
   Buttons, dropdowns, and real-time UI updates for an enhanced user experience.
